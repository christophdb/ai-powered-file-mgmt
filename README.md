# AI powered file management

AI has revolutionized how we access public knowledge, from Google Search to ChatGPT. However, these tools can't be safely used with confidential data, as demonstrated by recent incidents. 

This presentation introduces a solution: AI-powered private knowledge management systems. Using open-source tools, organizations can create secure, local AI chatbots that interact with their proprietary data. 

This approach offers enhanced information retrieval and analysis while maintaining data privacy. The presentation concludes with a live demo and discusses potential challenges and future implications for corporate knowledge management.

This presentation was held during [CS3 2025 in Munich](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1467643/overview).
